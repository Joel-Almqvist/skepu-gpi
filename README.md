# SkePU 3

SkePU 3 consists of four parts:

1. A sequential interface and accompanying implementation for C++ skeleton
programming.
2. A source-to-source precompiler tool built on top of the Clang C-language
compiler front-end, transforming code written for the sequential interface for
parallel and heterogeneous execution.
3. Minor patches to Clang to support said tool.
4. A collection of parallel and/or heterogeneous back-ends targeting various
architectures and systems.

## Setting up the SkePU source-to-source compiler

### Cloning with submodules

This repository should be cloned with `git clone --recursive $URL` in
order to also clone the submodules it links to. `git submodule update --init`
can be used to clone submodules to an existing repository.

### Building - Automatically

To compile SkePU-tool, run the foolowing commands in the project root:

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

`$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`

`$ make`

To install SkePU into <path>, run the following command from
<project_root>/build:

`$ make DESTDIR=<path> install`

If cmake does not generate Makefiles, use the option `-G "Unix Makefiles"`.
For more information about build options, run Â´cmake -LAH` in the build
directory. For information about how to configure cmake with compilers,
linkers, flags, and other such options, please refer to the cmake manuals at
the [cmake homepage](https://cmake.org).

## Compatibility with SkePU 1 and 2

SkePU v3 is not compatible with version 2 nor with version 1. Check the user
guide for more information.

SkePU 1 code is not compatible with SkePU 2 and vice-versa. SkePU 2 is in large
part based on concepts from SkePU 1, and the data structures are the same, so
it should be fairly straightworward to port a SkePU 1 project to SkePU 2. It
may require some effort to fit the SkePU 2 precompiler into a large project
with non-trivial build system, however.

## Directory layout

### `skepu-headers/src/`

As SkePU 3 is a header library, this directory contains headers and source
files for the SkePU runtime. Herafter refered to as <skepu-headers>.

#### `<skepu-headers>/skepu3`

Contains the serial skeleton interface (headers with inline implementations),
along with headers for SkePU containers.

##### `<skepu-headers>/skepu3/impl`

Helpers.

##### `<skepu-headers>/skepu3/backend`

Contains header files for the SkePU skeleton backends.

##### `<skepu-headers>/skepu3/backend/impl`

Contains implementations of the various SkePU skeleton backends and containers.

##### `<skepu-headers>skepu3/cluster`

Containes the implementation of the StarPU MPI backend.

### `examples`

Contains SkePU 3 example programs. Note that the Makefile requires skepu-tool
to have been built in <project root>/build to find skepu-tool.

### `llvm`

Sources for the source-to-source Clang tool. This directory is part of the LLVM
directory tree, and a symlink named
`<path_to_llvm>/llvm/tools/clang/tools/skepu` should link here.
